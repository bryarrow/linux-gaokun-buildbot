# linux-gaokun-buildbot

Build scripts, patches, kernel config, DTS files, tools, and firmware for Linux images targeting the Huawei MateBook E Go 2023 (codename `gaokun3`) based on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 (`SC8280XP`).

The image boots through `systemd-boot`, and a second EL2 kernel variant (`CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-gaokun3-el2"`) can be built alongside it.

## Goals

Ordered — when they conflict, the earlier one wins.

1. **The best experience on the MateBook E Go.** Hardware enablement comes first, even where it is unlike stock Fedora.
2. **A stock Fedora experience.** Everything the hardware does not force is Fedora's aarch64 Workstation image as it ships: its disk layout, SELinux enforcing, its package set, its defaults.
3. **Safe to daily drive.** No easier to break than an x86 Fedora install, and no guard rails Fedora itself does not have.

## What is included

### Repository layout

- `patches/`: kernel patches and device support changes
- `defconfig/`: local kernel configuration used by CI/manual builds
- `drivers/`: local mirrors of the patched driver sources kept in the patch series
- `dts/`: local mirrors of the patched device tree sources kept in the patch series
- `docs/`: usage/build guides and platform notes
- `firmware/`: minimal firmware bundle used by the image build
- `packaging/`: distro kernel and firmware package templates and metadata
- `tools/`: device-specific helper scripts, service files, and EL2 EFI payloads
- `scripts/ci/`: workflow build, image creation, and packaging scripts
- `scripts/local/`: some useful scripts that can be run on the local device

### Package outputs

The package pipeline builds and installs dedicated package sets:

- **Fedora (RPM)**: `kernel-gaokun3`, `kernel-modules-gaokun3`, `kernel-devel-gaokun3`, `linux-firmware-gaokun3`
- **Optional EL2 variants**: `*-gaokun3-el2` package set for the second EL2 kernel build

Installing or upgrading a kernel package refreshes the initramfs and the boot entry, and makes that kernel the one that boots.

### Releases

- Fedora image releases contain compressed installable images.
- Gaokun rescue USB releases contain a CLI-only Fedora image that boots this device from a USB stick, for installing the image above onto the internal disk or repairing an installation that no longer boots. It ships no installer: the procedure is [rescue_usb_guide_en.md](docs/rescue_usb_guide_en.md). **It has a published password (`fedora` / `fedora`) and `sshd` enabled**, so anyone on the same network can log in while it is running.
- Gaokun RPM releases contain the standalone kernel and firmware package sets used by the image workflow.

### Patch Sources

- `upstream/*` and `others/0017`: adapted from [right-0903/linux-gaokun](https://github.com/right-0903/linux-gaokun) for the base SC8280XP / gaokun3 enablement, display bring-up, EC suspend/resume, ADSP FastRPC, and DSI stability work
- `others/0001`: adapted from [whitelewi1-ctrl/matebook-e-go-linux](https://github.com/whitelewi1-ctrl/matebook-e-go-linux) to avoid setting `USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY` when the adapter address is invalid
- `others/0002`: local change in this repository to enable DSC and allow 60 Hz / 120 Hz switching
- `others/0003`: adapted from [chiyuki0325/EGoTouchRev-Linux](https://github.com/chiyuki0325/EGoTouchRev-Linux) to add the Himax HX83121A SPI touchscreen driver
- `others/0004`: adapted from [TheUnknownThing/linux-gaokun](https://github.com/TheUnknownThing/linux-gaokun) to improve UCSI handling and module wiring for the Type-C path
- `others/0009`: from the [gaokun-android](https://github.com/vahiru/gaokun-android) port — mainline `sc8280xp.dtsi` has no CPU cooling maps (only a 110 °C critical trip per zone), so the CPUs run flat out until an emergency shutdown; this adds an 85 °C passive trip to each of the eight per-core zones bound to that cluster's cpufreq cooling device. The gap is not specific to this machine, so the patch is written for upstream
- `dts/` and `defconfig/`: copied into the kernel tree by `scripts/lib/import_local_sources.sh` rather than carried as a patch, so they cannot conflict on a kernel bump
- **[Optional]** `el2/*`: adapted from [TravMurav/linux](https://github.com/TravMurav/linux/tree/x13s-6.18-v1.1-cxsd) for the EL2 boot path, including SMP2P handover, remoteproc attach/restart flow, SCM/SHM owner handling, and related rpmsg/QRTR/pmic_glink stability fixes

### Tool Sources

- `tools/audio`, `tools/bluetooth`: adapted from [whitelewi1-ctrl/matebook-e-go-linux](https://github.com/whitelewi1-ctrl/matebook-e-go-linux)
- `tools/el2/qebspilaa64.efi`: sourced from [stephan-gh/qebspil](https://github.com/stephan-gh/qebspil)
- `tools/el2/slbounceaa64.efi`: sourced from [TravMurav/slbounce](https://github.com/TravMurav/slbounce)
- `tools/touchscreen-tuner`: adapted from [chiyuki0325/EGoTouchRev-Linux](https://github.com/chiyuki0325/EGoTouchRev-Linux), with GTK4 GUI improvements in this repository

## Boot artifact layout

The image boots through `systemd-boot` with standard BLS entries generated by `kernel-install`.

- Entries are `loader/entries/fedora-<kernel-release>.conf` on the ESP, with the kernel, initrd and DTB under `fedora/<kernel-release>/` beside them. A copy of the DTB is kept in `/boot/dtb-<kernel-release>/qcom/` for anyone switching to GRUB later.
- The boot is verbose and Plymouth is off (`plymouth.enable=0`), where stock Fedora has `rhgb quiet`. Plymouth draws through DRM and ignores `fbcon=rotate:1`, so its splash and details view would come out sideways on this portrait panel; the kernel console honours the rotation.
- The entry editor is on (`editor yes`), so the kernel command line — `selinux=0` included — can be changed from the device instead of by mounting the ESP elsewhere.

## NixOS

A flake packages the gaokun3 kernel, the model firmware and the device tools,
and ships a NixOS module that wires them together — kernel, device tree, kernel
command line, module loading, Bluetooth NVM patching, display rotation and
audio UCM — behind one option:

```nix
{
  inputs.gaokun3 = {
    url = "github:KawaiiHachimi/linux-gaokun-buildbot";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
  outputs = { nixpkgs, gaokun3, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.ego = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
      modules = [
        gaokun3.nixosModules.gaokun3
        ({ ... }: { hardware.gaokun3.enable = true; })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Use `boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true`, which is what the device tree
support is tested with. The kernel targets aarch64; on an x86_64 builder the
flake's packages are cross-compiled. This NixOS support replaces the Fedora
image pipeline with a NixOS install; the two are independent.

The model firmware is redistributable but not modifiable, so evaluation refuses
it under a stock `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = false`; allow it explicitly:

```nix
{ nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg: builtins.elem (lib.getName pkg) [
    "linux-firmware-gaokun3"
  ]; }
```

### Language and input

The image ships `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` and no input method, matching the reference
Workstation image. Add your language in GNOME Settings and Fedora offers the
matching translations and input method.

For Chinese specifically there are two reasonable paths, and an image cannot
pick between them for you:

- `fcitx5-chinese-addons` works immediately, and its Pinyin dictionary is
  usually paired with `fcitx5-pinyin-zhwiki`.
- `fcitx5-rime` with [rime-ice](https://github.com/iDvel/rime-ice) (雾凇拼音) is
  what most people who care end up on. It needs its own configuration, which is
  the point of it.
