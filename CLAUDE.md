# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Audience split

`README.md` and `docs/*.md` are written for someone who owns a MateBook E Go and wants to flash, boot, dual-boot or repair it. Keep them to what such a person acts on. Build-system rationale, upstream evidence and rejected alternatives belong here instead, and inline comments stay to a line or two of local "why". If a comment or doc paragraph explains a distribution-policy decision, move it into this file rather than growing the source.

## Project goals, in order

When these conflict, the earlier one wins.

1. **The best experience on the MateBook E Go.** Hardware enablement comes before everything else. The DTS, kernel config, firmware bundle and quirks like `fbcon=rotate:1` stay even where they are unlike stock Fedora. RPM Fusion and `libavcodec-freeworld` ship enabled for the same reason.
2. **A stock Fedora experience.** The reference is Fedora's own aarch64 Workstation raw disk image for the release being built, plus anything [Fedora documents](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/workstation-docs/) for aarch64 Workstation. Where the hardware does not force our hand, match it rather than invent — the Btrfs layout, SELinux enforcing, no passwordless sudo. It also decides what to leave out: if that image ships no Pinyin input method or a language's translations, neither do we. Deviations must be deliberate and written down.
3. **Safe to daily drive.** No harder to break than an x86 Fedora install: `kernel-gaokun3` is protected from removal, Fedora's kernels are excluded because they cannot boot this device, and installing a kernel makes it the one that boots. Last on purpose — do not add guard rails Fedora itself does not have. `dnf system-upgrade` is left alone even though it is a real risk here.

Goal 2 has a corollary that keeps being got wrong: when Fedora already makes a decision, *inherit* it, do not restate it. An explicit `systemctl enable`/`disable` for a service Fedora presets already handle is dead weight at best and a silent deviation when Fedora changes its mind.

## What gets built

Three GitHub Actions workflows, all `workflow_dispatch`, all sharing the numbered scripts in `scripts/ci/`:

| Workflow | Product |
| --- | --- |
| `gaokun3-package-rpms.yml` | `kernel-gaokun3`, `kernel-modules-gaokun3`, `kernel-devel-gaokun3`, `linux-firmware-gaokun3` (plus `*-el2` variants) |
| `fedora-gaokun3-release.yml` | Fedora Workstation disk image; optionally calls the RPM workflow first |
| `gaokun3-rescue-release.yml` | CLI-only USB rescue image |

`build.env` pins `KERNEL_TAG` and `FEDORA_RELEASE` for all of them — workflows read it into `$GITHUB_ENV` right after checkout, `scripts/local/build_kernel.sh` sources it, and the build guide tells the reader to. Neither value is a dispatch input, because `patches/` applies to exactly one kernel tag and the package set to one Fedora release; bumping either belongs in the commit that refreshes what depends on it.

Script order is the numeric prefix: `10` fetch prebuilt RPMs from a release → `20` build kernel variants → `30` bootstrap the rootfs with dnf → `50`/`55` create the image → `60`/`65` compress and write release notes. `70` builds the RPMs and is what `10` later downloads. Each script takes its inputs as required environment variables checked with `: "${VAR:?}"` at the top; the workflow YAML is the only caller that sets them.

## Verifying a change

The build needs Linux, `sudo`, loop devices and `dnf --installroot`, and is not worth running by hand even where it can run. Verify by reading and by static analysis, then let CI build:

```sh
shellcheck scripts/ci/*.sh scripts/ci/lib/*.sh scripts/lib/*.sh scripts/local/*.sh
bash -n <script>
```

`.shellcheckrc` sets `external-sources`/`source-path=SCRIPTDIR` so sourced libs resolve. There is no test suite; the real check is a CI run plus a boot on the device, which only the user can do. Privileged commands are handed to the user rather than run here.

Claims about what Fedora ships are settled against a `fedora:<release>` image with the repos this build uses — `dnf --assumeno install <the image's package set>` names every package that actually lands, and `repoquery --whatprovides` names the owner of a file. Do that before quoting dist-git: `rawhide` is a different Fedora than the one being built.

RPM specs are `packaging/rpm/*.spec.in` templates with `@PLACEHOLDER@` tokens substituted by `render_spec_template` in `70_build_package_rpms.sh`; `rpmspec`/`rpmlint` cannot parse them directly.

## Easy things to get wrong

- **The image is not built from Fedora's Workstation disk image.** `30_bootstrap_rootfs.sh` runs `dnf --installroot` inside a `fedora:<release>` container and installs comps groups (`@core @standard @gnome-desktop @workstation-product` plus the workflow's extras). "Stock Workstation" is therefore an outcome to check, not a starting point — a package the real Workstation image gets through the installer or through a weak dependency may simply be absent here. Check with a resolve run before asserting either way.
- **Service enablement is preset-driven, and the presets are in the rootfs.** On F44 `fedora-release-identity-workstation` ships `81-desktop.preset` (`disable sshd.socket`, `disable sshd.service`, cups socket activation) and `fedora-release-common` ships `85-display-manager.preset` (`enable gdm.service`) and `90-default.preset` (`enable NetworkManager.service`, and `enable sshd.service`, which 81 overrides by sorting first). Both land in our transaction, so the only `systemctl enable` the image needs is for units this repo ships. `preset-all` on first boot is enable-only, so it never undoes a disable.
- **`firmware/` contains symlinks, and `find -type f` hides them.** `SC8280XP-HUAWEI-GAOKUN3-tplg.bin` is a link to `HUAWEI/gaokun3/audioreach-tplg.bin`, which is the name the sound card asks for. Enumerate that tree with `git ls-files` or `find -mindepth 1`; a dangling symlink left behind also makes `hashFiles` in the workflows fail, which kills every job before it starts.
- **A wrong `install_items` path in a dracut fragment is silent.** `dracut` calls `inst_multiple` without checking its return value, so a missing file prints `FAILED:` in the build log and the initramfs is built without it. Nothing downstream fails. Firmware added there has to be verified with `lsinitrd`.
- **The firmware bundle is model-specific only.** Everything generic — WCN6855, QCA Bluetooth, Adreno 660 — comes from Fedora's `atheros-firmware`/`qcom-firmware`, which ship it identical or newer. Before adding a file under `firmware/`, check whether Fedora already has it; if a Fedora file has to be overridden, it goes to `/usr/lib/firmware/updates/` with the reason recorded, never by conflicting with the package.
- **Fedora's dist-git `rawhide` branch is not the release being built.** The `redhat-systemd-presets*` packages that own the presets in rawhide do not exist on F44, where the same files ship inside `fedora-release-*`.

## Architecture notes that span files

**Kernel source assembly** (`20_build_kernel_variants.sh`): `patches/upstream/*`, `patches/others/*`, then `patches/himax/*` are applied with `git am` to a checkout of `torvalds/linux` at `KERNEL_TAG`, each in the order fixed by its `series` file (which must list every `.patch` in the directory exactly once). Then `scripts/lib/import_local_sources.sh` *copies* `dts/` and `defconfig/` into the tree and commits them. Those two directories are owned outright, not diffed against mainline, so a kernel bump cannot conflict in them — edit the files here, never a patch. The base tree is snapshotted before `patches/el2/*` is applied on top, so the EL2 variant is a second build of the same source with `LOCALVERSION=-gaokun3-el2`.

**Boot layout** is BLS via `kernel-install` (`layout=bls`), with systemd-boot on a 1 GiB ESP; nothing boots out of `/boot`. Invariants that several files depend on together:

- `--entry-token=os-id` everywhere, recorded in `/etc/kernel/entry-token`. The default `machine-id` token would resolve differently on the device than at build time and orphan the entries. The rescue image uses its own token so a stick and a target install never collide.
- `kernel-install` owns the initramfs. Never call `dracut` before it: `50-dracut.install` builds into its own staging area and only reuses a pre-built image named `initrd` next to the kernel, which `dracut --force`'s `/boot/initramfs-<kver>.img` is not.
- `/etc/machine-id` ships as `uninitialized`, matching Fedora's kiwi `config.sh`. systemd treats missing or `uninitialized` as first boot; an *empty* file gets an id but is explicitly not a first boot. Because first boot now really fires, `systemd-firstboot` pre-answers locale/keymap/timezone at build time (as kiwi does for `<locale>/<keytable>/<timezone>`), or `systemd-firstboot.service` — ordered before `sysinit.target` with `StandardInput=tty` — would block the boot in front of gdm.
- `kernel-gaokun3`'s `%posttrans` rewrites `loader.conf`'s `default` so an installed kernel becomes the booting one; the EL2 package must never claim it.
- Fedora's `51-dracut-rescue.install` is symlinked to `/dev/null`: its `0-rescue` entry carries no `devicetree` and cannot boot this device.

**Image assets** shared by both images live in `tools/image-assets/` and are installed by `scripts/ci/lib/common_image.sh`, which also selects the `desktop` or `rescue` module-load profile. Adding a file under `modules-load.d/` requires updating the `rescue` profile's explicit list.

## Fedora alignment

The ownership boundary: Fedora owns distribution policy, boot layout, kernel lifecycle, package composition, security defaults and generic firmware. This repo owns the Gaokun3 DTB, the drivers and fixes that are not upstream yet, model firmware, physical display/input quirks, and the experimental EL2 path. When something here answers a question Fedora already answers, match Fedora.

Reference points worth re-reading before changing boot or image behaviour: Fedora's [`fedora-kiwi-descriptions`](https://pagure.io/fedora-kiwi-descriptions) `config.sh` and `Fedora.kiwi`, the [Snapdragon WoA install page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Snapdragon_WoA_Laptop_Install), and Fedora's kernel dist-git scriptlets.

### Kernel command line

Set in `50_make_image_fedora.sh` and `55_make_image_rescue.sh`. Every entry needs a reason:

| Parameter | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `clk_ignore_unused`, `pd_ignore_unused` | Fedora-documented SC8280XP workarounds. `pd_ignore_unused` may be obsolete since power-domain `sync_state` landed — untested here. |
| `arm64.nopauth`, `efi=noruntime` | Fedora-documented 8cx Gen 3 firmware workarounds |
| `fbcon=rotate:1` | Portrait panel |
| `usbhid.quirks=0x12d1:0x10b8:0x20000000` | Huawei keyboard |
| `plymouth.enable=0` | Plymouth draws through DRM and ignores `fbcon=rotate:1`, so splash and details view come out sideways. UX, not boot safety. |
| `pcie_aspm.policy=powersupersave` | Global policy override with no Fedora precedent and no measurement behind it. Candidate for removal. |
| `modprobe.blacklist=simpledrm` | EL2 only |

Removed as no-ops and not to be reintroduced: `consoleblank=0` (`blankinterval` starts at 0 in `drivers/tty/vt/vt.c`) and `psi=1` (`CONFIG_PSI=y`, `PSI_DEFAULT_DISABLED` unset). `systemd.tpm2_wait=0` is documented by Fedora for 8cx Gen 3 but has never been shown necessary here.

### Known divergences not yet addressed

An external audit (2026-08-13, against `f224d2f`) catalogued these. Fixed since: machine-id first-boot semantics, the duplicate `dracut` run, dead cmdline entries, a `modules-load.d/battery.conf` naming built-in drivers, `systemctl` calls restating Fedora presets, the firmware package's forced erasure of Fedora's, the triplicated dracut fragment, and `%posttrans` doing boot-entry work with no ESP. What remains, roughly by value:

- `defconfig/gaokun3_defconfig` is an independent distribution kernel policy, not a delta over Fedora's aarch64 config: of 484 shared symbols, 118 differ, including LSM order, preemption, tracing and whole driver families. The target is Fedora's config plus a small reviewed Gaokun fragment.
- The kernel RPMs do not implement Fedora's kernel package semantics (`installonlypkg(kernel)`, `kernel-uname-r` provides, module-tree layout), and compensate with `/etc/dnf/protected.d` and a global `excludepkgs`. The Fedora-kernel exclusion itself is justified — stock kernels cannot boot this device.
- The `add_drivers` list in the packaged dracut fragment is unpruned: with `hostonly=no`, most of it is redundant, and only what is needed before switch-root belongs there. Trimming it needs `lsinitrd` plus a cold boot.
- The remaining `modules-load.d` files force modules that should autoload from DT/PCI/HID aliases. Each removal needs a cold-boot log, not reasoning.
- The package selection is a curated remix (pruned Workstation plus RPM Fusion and `libavcodec-freeworld`), which the README's stated goals acknowledge but which is not stock Workstation.
- The standard image uses systemd-boot where Fedora aarch64 uses GRUB+BLS; that choice is what creates the ESP-copy, entry-token, rescue-entry and default-selection machinery.

Anything requiring hardware evidence (module autoload, ASPM, `pd_ignore_unused`) can only be settled by the user on the device — ask for a cold-boot log rather than guessing.

## Conventions

Commit subjects are plain sentences in the imperative with no `type:` prefix, e.g. "Mount the ESP the way Fedora does, and stop building initramfses twice". The body carries the evidence: what upstream says, what was measured, what was rejected. `main` is the working branch; the user pushes.
